        <p4>In the United States in 2020 there were approximately 415,000 reported crashes 
            involving large trucks. The number of crashes has increased over the years from 
            the demand of shipping products country wide. Our product Safe Pass Display (S.P.D) 
            is focused on increasing traveling safety in rural and urban areas by providing a 
            live high-definition image displayed on an LCD screen to the rear of large trucks 
            and other vehicles of the oncoming lane of traffic. This would eliminate the need 
            for drivers to try and peek around the large vehicle ahead of them to know if the
            passing conditions are safe. The model system consists of a Raspberry Pi © 2011.12,  
            OSOYOO Raspberry Pi Screen Monitor, Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2-8 Megapixel to
            display in 1080p, and a 3D modeled eighteen wheeler semi-truck. The Raspberry Pi 
            in the model will be powered by an independent battery ranging from five to nine volts, 
            the camera will provide the Raspberry Pi with live footage which will be decoded and displayed 
            live to LCD monitor. For this demonstration the monitor will be mounted as the entire rear
            of the semi truck, however in application this will be exchanged for a larger LCD monitor 
            with better resolution to provide drivers with a clear 4k image and the electrical systems 
            can be tied into existing ones.</p4></center>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <center>
        <p4>The inspiration for this project revolves around the concern for safety. Samsung first 
            made their own version of the “Samsung Safety Truck”. Through the use of the latest technology, 
            systems like smart trucks can be implemented into large vehicles on the road to allow for more 
            accurate passing potential and more informed driving decisions. The objective of Safe Pass 
            Display is to provide drivers with ease of mind when trying to overtake a large vehicle on 
            the road that hinders visibility. Large vehicles like semi trucks have four large blind spots
            which vary in range depending on what side of the vehicle you are on. The device implemented
            will be an external system that ties into the existing system running on the voltage from the 
            battery.</p4></center>
